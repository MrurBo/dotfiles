# My termux dotfiles
This repository contains all my configs and dotfiles.

## **REMINDER** These are configs for my TERMUX (A terminal emulator for android) and NOT for other devices. To use on other devices please read on.

## OTHER DEVICES

To use on other devices:

1. Fork this repository
2. Modify how you like (e.g. remove tmux or change ps1)
3. Clone it to any computer you want and symlink the files.

## I dont recommend cloning this repository on it own.
